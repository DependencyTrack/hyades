# Always use quotes for keywords, column- and table names.
# e.g. SELECT "FOO"."BAR" FROM "BAZ". This matches what the API server does,
# and is required for compatibility with its schema.

# Hibernate should only validate that the existing schema matches our entity classes,
# but it should never generate a schema by itself.
quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation=validate
# Use Flyway only in test mode to populate the DB with the schema generated
# by the API server. In production or dev mode, this will be handled by the
# API server itself. See https://quarkus.io/guides/flyway
