# Roles 


# Scoped Permissions

With the addition to the introduction of `Roles`, we had to normalize the permssion model for more fine-grained access control. The current set was split into global, shared, and teams/project based permission. 
This is done by seperating the current `NAME` text value into the distinct cincepts of `RESOURCE` and `ACCESS_LEVEL`. The enforcemen is implemented through a combination of annotations, query logic, and request filteringâ€”particularly in the context of REST API endpoints that deal with projects and their related resources.

Current `PERMISSION TABLE`:

    PERMISSION {
        BIGINT ID PK
        TEXT NAME
        TEXT DESCRIPTION
    }
```

Implemented `PERMISSION TABLE`:

    PERMISSION {
        BIGINT ID PK
        TEXT RESOURCE
        TEXT ACCESS_LEVEL

    }
```
