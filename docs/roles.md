# Roles 
Roles increase privacy and allow for better ease of use in large scale projects. Roles are synced to the user's Gitlab account with their LM SSO and they are automatically given access to the necessary projects. Custom roles are also included, allowing for the user to create unique permissions for specific use case.

# Scoped Permissions

With the addition of `Roles`, we had to normalize the permssion model for more fine-grained access control. The current model was split into a global, shared, and teams/project based permission set. 
This is done by seperating the current `NAME` text value into the distinct concepts of `RESOURCE` and `ACCESS_LEVEL`. The enforcement is implemented through a combination of annotations, query logic, and request filteringâ€”particularly in the context of REST API endpoints that deal with projects and their related resources.
