## Introduction

Vulnerability policies offer a means to automatically apply analysis decisions to vulnerability findings.
They provide VEX-like capabilities, but can be tied to conditions. This makes them incredibly powerful.

Vulnerability policies are evaluated immediately upon reception of vulnerability analysis results.
Their outcome is applied atomically with the registration of the respective finding itself.
