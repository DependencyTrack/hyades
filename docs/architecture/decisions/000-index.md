Here is where we keep our architecture decision records ([ADR]s).

## Template

Use the following template ([source]) when adding a new [ADR]:

```markdown linenums="1"
| Status                                               | Date       | Author(s)                                        |
|:-----------------------------------------------------|:-----------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated, Superseded | yyyy-mm-dd | [@githubHandle](https://github.com/githubHandle) |

## Context

What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
