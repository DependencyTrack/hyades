## What is this? ü§î

Hyades, named after [the star cluster closest to earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyades_(star_cluster)), 
decouples responsibilities from [Dependency-Track]'s monolithic API server into separate, 
scalable‚Ñ¢ services. We're using [Kafka] (or Kafka-compatible brokers like [Redpanda]) for communicating between API 
server and Hyades services.

If you're interested in the technical background of this project, please refer to üëâ [`WTF.md`](WTF.md) üëà.

As of now, Hyades is capable of:

* Performing vulnerability analysis using scanners that leverage:
  * Dependency-Track's internal vulnerability database
  * [OSS Index](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/)
  * [Snyk](https://snyk.io/)
* Gathering component metadata (e.g. latest available version) from remote repositories
* Sending [notifications](https://docs.dependencytrack.org/integrations/notifications/) via all channels supported by the original API server (E-Mail, Webhook, etc.)

Here's a rough overview of the architecture:

![Architecture Overview](./architecture-overview.png)

To read more about the individual services, refer to their respective `REAMDE.md`:

* [Repository Metadata Analyzer](./repository-meta-analyzer/README.md)
* [Vulnerability Analyzer](./vulnerability-analyzer/README.md)

## Great, can I try it? üôå

Yes! We prepared demo setup that you can use to play around with Hyades.  
Check out üëâ [`DEMO.md`](DEMO.md) üëà for details!

## Technical Documentation üíª

### Configuration üìù

See [`CONFIGURATION.md`](CONFIGURATION.md).

### Development

#### Prerequisites

* JDK 17+
* Docker

#### Building

```shell
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

#### Running locally

Running the Hyades services locally requires both a Kafka broker and a database server to be present.
Containers for Redpanda and PostgreSQL can be launched using Docker Compose:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

To launch individual services execute the `quarkus:dev` Maven goal for the respective module:

```shell
mvn -pl vulnerability-analyzer quarkus:dev
```

Make sure you've [built](#building) the project at least once, otherwise the above command will fail.

> **Note**  
> If you're unfamiliar with Quarkus' Dev Mode, you can read more about it 
> [here](https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling#dev-mode)

### Testing ü§û

#### Unit Testing üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

To execute the unit tests for all Hyades modules:

```shell
mvn clean verify
```

#### End-To-End Testing üßü

> **Note**  
> End-to-end tests are based on container images. The tags of those images are currently hardcoded.
> For the Hyades services, the tags are set to `latest`. If you want to test local changes, you'll have
> to first:
> * Build container images locally
> * Update the tags in [`AbstractE2ET`](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/hyades/blob/main/e2e/src/test/java/org/hyades/e2e/AbstractE2ET.java)

To execute end-to-end tests as part of the build:

```shell
mvn clean verify -Pe2e-all
```

To execute *only* the end-to-end tests:

```shell
mvn -pl e2e clean verify -Pe2e-all
```

#### Load Testing üöÄ

See [`load-tests`](load-tests).

### Deployment üö¢

The recommended way to deploy Hyades is via Helm. Our [chart](./helm-charts/hyades) is now officially published
in the [helm-charts](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/helm-charts) repository.

The chart does *not* include:

* a database
* a Kafka-compatible broker
* the API server
* the frontend

While API server and frontend will eventually be included, database and Kafka broker will not.

Helm charts to deploy Kafka brokers to Kubernetes are provided by both [Strimzi](https://strimzi.io/) 
and [Redpanda](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts). 

#### Minikube

Deploying to a local [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) cluster is a great way to get started.

> **Note**  
> For now, services not included in the Helm chart are deployed using Docker Compose.

1. Start PostgreSQL and Redpanda via Docker Compose
```shell
docker compose up -d
```
2. Start the API server and frontend
```shell
docker compose up -d apiserver frontend
```
3. Start a local Minikube cluster
```shell
minikube start
```
4. Deploy Hyades
```shell
helm install hyades ./helm-charts/ \
  -n hyades --create-namespace \
  -f ./helm-charts/hyades/values.yaml \
  -f ./helm-charts/hyades/values-minikube.yaml
```

### Monitoring üìä

#### Metrics

A basic metrics monitoring stack is provided, consisting of Prometheus and Grafana.  
To start both services, run:

```shell
docker compose --profile monitoring up -d
```

The services will be available locally at the following locations:

* Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
* Grafana: http://localhost:3000

Prometheus is [configured](monitoring/prometheus.yml) to scrape metrics from the following services in a 5s intervals:

* Redpanda Broker
* API Server
* Notification Publisher
* Repository Meta Analyzer
* Vulnerability Analyzer

The Grafana instance will be automatically [provisioned](monitoring/grafana/provisioning) to use Prometheus as
data source. Additionally, dashboards for the following services are automatically set up:

* Redpanda Broker
* API Server
* Vulnerability Analyzer

#### Redpanda Console üêº

The provided `docker-compose.yml` includes an instance of [Redpanda Console](https://github.com/redpanda-data/console)
to aid with gaining insight into what's happening in the message broker. Among many other things, it can be used to
inspect messages inside any given topic.

![Redpanda Console - Messages](./images/redpanda-console_messages.png)

The console is exposed at `http://127.0.0.1:28080` and does not require authentication. It's intended for local use only.
