## 1. Playwright Minimum Requirements (as of March 2025) 🔧

To install and execute Playwright tests, ensure you meet the following minimum requirements:

- Latest version of Node.js 18, 20, or 22.
- Supported Operating Systems:
  - Windows 10+, Windows Server 2016+, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
  - macOS 13 Ventura or later.
  - Debian 12, Ubuntu 22.04, Ubuntu 24.04 (x86-64 and arm64 architecture).

### 1.1 Installation 📦

To set up Playwright, run the following command in the root directory of your project:

```sh
npm run playwright:init
```

This script installs the dev-dependencies present inside `package.json` and the dependencies necessary for playwright to function (e.g. browsers)

If no errors occur, you're ready to use Playwright! 🎉 _If errors occur, stay calm and [troubleshoot](#4-troubleshooting-)!_ 🚨

### 1.2 Configuration 🛠️

All the configuration is happening inside `playwright.config.ts`.
Most of the configuration should be trivial, but adding playwright-bdd to it is a bit different.
This snippet is used to configure BDD part of Playwright. 
```typescript
const gherkinTestDir = defineBddConfig({
  tags: '@projects or @permissions and not @todo',
  features: playwrightTestDir + '/features/**/*.feature',
  steps: [playwrightTestDir + '/steps/*.steps.ts', playwrightTestDir + '/fixtures/fixtures.ts'],
  outputDir: playwrightTestDir + '/.features-gen/tests',
});
```

- **testDir**: Specifies the directory where the test files are located.
- **outputDir**: Defines where test artifacts (e.g., screenshots, videos) are saved.
- **timeout**: Time allowed for each individual test to run.
- **reporter**: Specifies the format and destination for test reports.
- **globalSetup**: A script that runs before all tests to set up the environment.
- **use**: Global settings for browser context, like base URL, video recording, and screenshots.
- **projects**: Defines configurations for running tests across different browsers or devices. Makes use of the bdd code-snippet

But rather than creating another wiki here, we would suggest visiting the [Playwright Config Documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration) or look at the [playwright.config.ts](./../../playwright.config.ts)

## 2. Tests with Playwright BDD 📜

Playwright does not natively support Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) ([official issue](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/11975)), but recommends a plugin that makes it possible: [Playwright BDD](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/).
That Plugin basically translates Gherkin into executable tests for the Playwright runner. The generated tests will be located in `/.feature-gen`.

### 2.1 Writing a Test with Gherkin Syntax ✍️

We use Playwright-BDD for the tests, which makes use of cucumber/gherkin. 

**Feature**: High-level functionality written in `.feature` files using Gherkin syntax.
```gherkin
Feature: VIEW_PORTFOLIO
  Scenario: Without VIEW_PORTFOLIO Permission The User Cannot Log In
    Given the user "test-user0_PERMS" tries to log in to DependencyTrack
    Then the user receives login error toast
```
**Steps**: Define the behavior for each scenario step, implemented in `.step.ts`-files linking with the Gherkin steps:
```typescript
Given('the user {string} tries to log in to DependencyTrack', async ({ loginPage }, username: string) => {
  await loginPage.goto();
  await loginPage.verifyVisibleLoginPage();
  await loginPage.login(username, process.env.RANDOM_PASSWORD);
});
```
**Page Objects**: Similar to classes but for locators of a page (e.g. [LoginPage](./page-objects/login.pom.ts))

**Fixtures**: Used to isolate test steps from another by initializing page-objects for each step (e.g. loginPage from the Given-step above)

### 2.2 Running a Test 🧪

In order to run the tests, DependencyTrack must be running on `localhost`. Configuration for the baseURL can be done in `playwright.config.ts`.
Some scripts are already present within `package.json`. They refer to the respective projects mentioned inside `playwright.config.ts` and follow a default structure:
![Playwright Setup Order](../../docs/images/playwright-setup-order.png)

When running the tests for example in chromium, you would use the following script
```sh
npm run playwright:test:chromium
```

It will run all the tests, including the setup. 
Initially DependencyTrack is not set up, so you can run the following command, which will change the password of admin to the value set inside [local-auth.json](./resources/local-auth.json)
```shell
playwright:clean:initial:chromium
```

**V1 of the setup takes quite long so if you just want to run the tests without the setup, use**:
```sh
npm run playwright:test:only:chromium
```
**But keep in mind, that when only running the tests, the previous data will not be cleaned up.**
By adding `@only` above a feature (or scenario), you can reduce the test count to just that feature (or to just a scenario), depending on your use case 😎👌

### 2.3 Debugging 🐛

When a test is failing and there is not enough information in the report, running the test-command with certain parameters can help to narrow it down.
Common debugging parameters are:

- `--headed` - Runs tests visually.
- `--debug` - Enables the integrated debugger (does not require `--headed`).
- `--ui` - Opens a UI similar.

E.g. (Don't forget to add `--` before, as you are passing a parameter into a script)

```sh
npm run playwright:test:chromium -- --headed
```

To use the Trace Viewer for debugging just open [Playwright Trace Viewer](https://trace.playwright.dev/) and locate the trace file inside the report folder.

## 3. Test Report 📊

For reporting, different solutions are used based on the environment:

### 3.1 Local - HTML Report 🖥️

Playwright's built-in HTML report is used locally. The report opens automatically if there were failing tests, but you can still open the report by running:

```sh
npm run playwright:show:report
```

### 3.2 CI/CD - Allure Report 📡

For CI/CD purposes [Allure Report](https://allurereport.org/) is used for reporting.
The configuration is inside [e2e-playwright-allure_report.yml](./../../.github/workflows/e2e-playwright-allure_report.yml).
We basically execute the tests, let allure generate a report and publish it on the owasp allure-report-repository by using github-pages. 🙌

## 4 Troubleshooting 🚑

**Potential Issues:**

- **Playwright installation errors?**
  - _Ensure you have the correct Node.js version (18, 20, or 22) and try reinstalling dependencies:_
- **Test Errors occur?**
  - _Verify that the .feature-files are referenced properly inside the .steps.ts-files_
- _There may be more issues coming in the future_

## 5 Current Coverage ✅

As of March 2025 V1 of the tests do not cover all functionality, that DependencyTrack provides.
It provides coverage for the main permissions and important features for projects. Check out `e2e/playwright-tests/features`.

## 6 Updating Dependencies 🎭

Updating the dependencies inside `package.json` also needs updating `package-lock.json`. This can be achieved by running

```shell
npm install
```

For more details, visit the [official Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/) and [Playwright-BDD](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/) for the BDD approach.
